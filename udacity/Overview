## Intro to AB Testing - what can and can't do with AB testing
Used to test out new product/features. How do these users repond differently - determine which version is better. 

There are certain limitations to what we cannot test, for example, A. *new experience. * 
- Novelty effect
- Change aversion

Two issues to consider for testing out new experience:
1. baseline for comparison.
2. how much time needed for users to adapt to new experience - what is the plateaued experience to make a robust decision.

B. Time can be a problem for short term a/b testing, e.g. rental referrals. We don't know how much time needed for users to come back with a referral etc. There are certain proxies that we can use and will talk more in later sessions.

C. A/B testing can't tell you if you are missing something. We can know through AB testing that which review to show is better, but can't know if we are missing another review at all.
